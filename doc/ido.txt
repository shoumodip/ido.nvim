Ido mode of Emacs brought to Neovim. For those unfamiliar with Emacs,
ido is essentially a completion framework, like 'fzf'. It's main feature
is (|imho|) the 'prefix' feature. See below for information on the 'prefix'
feature.

Just like Ido in Emacs, it is |completely| |extensible|. All the settings
are in Lua, so it's a simple

  |lua| |varname| = 'value'

*ido_fuzzy_matching* - Whether Ido should match fuzzily or not. |True| by
default.

*ido_case_sensitive* - Whether Ido should match case-sensitively. |False|
by default.

*ido_overlap_statusline* - Whether the Ido floating window should overlap the
statusline or not. |False| by default.

*ido_min_lines* - The minimum boundary of the Ido minibuffer. Only
important if 'ido_limit_lines' is |True|. (See below)

*ido_max_lines* - The maximum boundary of the Ido minibuffer. Only has any
effect if 'ido_limit_lines' is |False|. (See below)

*ido_limit_lines* - If the number of lines in the Ido minibuffer exceeds
ido_min_lines, whether to show the 'more_items' symbol or make the
minibuffer 'ido_max_lines' tall. |True| by default.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ido_decorations* - The fun part, all the Eyecandy. This is a Lua table,
so all configurations are done in the following format -

  |lua| |ido_decorations|['item'] = |value|

Available configuration options --

  |prefixstart| - The character shown before the |prefix|. See below for stuff
  about the 'prefix'. By default, it is '|[|'.

  |prefixend| - The character shown after the prefix. By default, it is '|]|'.

  |matchstart| - The character shown before the available matches. (if
any) By default it is ''.

  |matchend| - The character shown after the matches. By default it is ''.

  |separator| - The separator between matches. By default it is ' *|* '.

  |marker| - The indicator for the current item. By default it is ''.

  |moreitems| - The character which denotes there are more matches which are
not being rendered. Has no effect if |ido_limit_lines| is false. By default
it is '|...|'.

Example --

  |lua| |ido_decorations|['separator']  = '\n    '
  |lua| |ido_decorations|['matchstart'] = '\n'
  |lua| |ido_decorations|['marker']     = ' -> '
  |lua| |ido_decorations|['moreitems']  = ''

  This will create a vertical layout for Ido --

  |Files:| d|[o]|
      |->| documents
         downloads

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ido_prefix* - The most awesome feature in existence. When using Ido, it will
provide the least common prefix substring as a |suggestion|. Pressing <Tab>
will do what you expect - tab completion! If there is only item as a match,
the entire match will become the prefix and on pressing <Tab>, it will
complete the prefix and accept the item like <Return>.

    |Find| |files:| d|[o]| {documents | downloads}

Here |[o]| is the prefix being suggested as the substring |do| is present at
the beginning of the all the available matches.

    |>>>| mus|[music]|

Here |[music]| is the only available match. Therefore the entire item is the
suggestion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ido_keys* - The hotkeys used.
These are declared in |ido_keybindings|. See 'ido-api' for more information.

<C-n>    The next item
<C-p>    The previous item

<C-f>    Forward a character
<C-b>    Backward a character

<C-a>    Start of line
<C-e>    End of line

<Right>  Forward a character
<Left>   Backward a character

<Tab>    Prefix completion
<Return> Accept the selected item, else accept the pattern text
<Escape> Escape Ido, duh.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use Ido.

  *ido_complete* is a lua function which takes a table as an argument. The
table can contain four items / subtables --

  |prompt| The prompt to be used. If left blank, then |ido_default_prompt|
will be used.

  |items| The list of items to match on.

  |keybinds| Custom keybindings to be used. If left default, then
  ido_keybindings will be used.

  |on_enter| The function which will be executed on returning the value.

  For example.
  |lua| |print(ido_complete({|prompt = 'Choose: ', items = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}|}))|

  Or just use the default prompt.
  |lua| |print(ido_complete({|items = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}|}))|

  Maybe a custom function.

  |lua| |print(ido_complete({|items = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}, on_enter = function(s) print(s) end|}))|

  Note: Particular order does not matter here. The options can be placed in
  whatsoever way you want. There is no specification on whether prompt should
  be placed at the first or something like that.

  For a more "complex" example, check out |ido_find_files()| in |menus.lua|

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ido_colors* - These are the highlight groups used in Ido.
Note: These are adjusted to the color settings of |my| terminal configuration.
To make Ido look normal in yours, you need to change some color settings.

|IdoWindow| The highlight color of the Ido window.

|IdoCursor| The virtual cursor emulation used in Ido.

|IdoSelectedMatch| The color for the selected match.

|IdoPrefix| The color used for the prefix.

|IdoSeparator| The color used for the separator, the match start character
and the match end character.

|IdoPrompt| The color used for the prompt.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ido-api* Ido mode was originally from Emacsland. Therefore not provinding an
API would be sacriligeous. Since Ido mode is near enough infinitely
extensible, therefore this is divided into 3 parts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Keybindings| It is divided into two parts -- the global keybindings and the
temporary keybindings.

Keybindings consist of the following pattern --
  ["|KEYNAME|"] = '|FUNCTION|'

  where |KEYNAME| is the key binding in standard vim notation (see
  'key-notation').

  And |FUNCTION| is a global Lua function, emphasis on global. I could'nt find
  a way to make it work with local functions, so unless you have a solution
  and create a pull request, global functions it is. Also the functions must
  not have the '(|<args>|)' part. There can be no parenthesis at the end used
  for calling a function.

  |global| These are the keybindings used in every single instance of Ido.
  This is set in the |ido_keybindings| table.

    |ido_keybindings| = {
      ["\\<Right>"] = 'ido_cursor_move_begin',
      ["\\<Left>"]  = 'ido_cursor_move_end',
    }

  NOTE: After changing the global keybindings, you have to execute the
  |ido_load_keys()| lua function in order to, you know, load the keys.
  Otherwise they won't take effect.

  |temporary| These are keybindings used in only one instance of Ido, and are
  defined in the table of options supplied to |ido_complete|.

    |ido_complete({|items = {'red', 'green', 'blue'}, keybinds = {["\\<Right>"] = 'ido_cursor_move_end'}|})|

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Variables| The variables used in Ido mode --

  *ido_matched_items* The table of the items matched.

  *ido_window* The floating window belonging to Ido.

  *ido_buffer* The buffer used by Ido.

  *ido_before_cursor* The text present before the virtual cursor position in Ido.

  *ido_after_cursor* The text present after the virtual cursor position in Ido.

  *ido_prefix* The prefix

  *ido_prefix_text* The complete prefix, containing the pattern and the prefix.

  *ido_current_item* The current selected item in Ido.

  *ido_render_text* The text being rendered in Ido.

  *ido_default_prompt* The default prompt of Ido. ('>>> ')

  *ido_cursor_position* The virtual cursor position of Ido.

  *ido_more_items* Whether there are more items which are not being rendered.

  *ido_pattern_text* The pattern being matched in the items.

  *ido_match_list* The list of items on which the pattern is being matched.

  *ido_prompt* The prompt being used.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Functions| The functions defined in Ido are --

  *ido_close_window* Close the Ido window and stop the character input loop.

  *ido_get_matches* Get the items which match with the pattern. Also find out
  the prefix.

  *ido_insert_char* Insert the character you last pressed. Does |not| take any
  argument.

  *ido_key_backspace* Emulate the backspace key in Ido.

  *ido_key_delete* Emulate the delete key in Ido.

  *ido_cursor_move_left* Move the virtual cursor left a character.

  *ido_cursor_move_right* Move the virtual cursor right a character.

  *ido_cursor_move_begin* Move the virtual cursor to the beginning of the
  pattern.

  *ido_cursor_move_end* Move the virtual cursor to the endning of the
  pattern.

  *ido_next_item* Select the next match.

  *ido_prev_item* Select the previous match.

  *ido_complete_prefix* Complete the prefix.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

|Special| |Functions| The functions which aren't really functions but are
recognised by Ido by an 'if-else' statement. Meant to be used |only| in
keybindings. I repeat, "Do not try to use this in your function or whatever!"

  *ido_accept* Accept the current item.

  *ido_complete_prefix* Complete the prefix. If there is only one matching
  item, then behaves the same as |ido_accept|.
